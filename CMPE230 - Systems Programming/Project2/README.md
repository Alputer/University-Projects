# 230-Project2

In this project, you will implement an assembler and an execution simulator for a hypothetical CPU called CPU230. CPU230 is a 24bit one operand CPU having 4 addressing modes and 29 instractions.
For further details about this CPU, check "description.pdf".


# Running The Code

To produce binary code of an assembly file (say prog.asm), execute this command:

```bash
cpu230assemble prog.asm
```
This command creates "prog.bin" file.

To run the CPU simulation, execute this command:

```bash
cpu230exec prog.bin
```
